What makes a restaurant successful? For restaurateurs, it is crucial to under-
stand their business in order to improve their performance and increment their
clientele. However, in the restaurant industry, making data driven decisions can
be challenging. 

With this project, we want to explore all the information contained in Tri-
pAdvisor and possibly other data bases to answer the following questions:

 - Based on available public data, Can we help restaurant owners to under-
stand their industry?
 - Can we extract insights to improve the rating of a restaurant that already
exists?
 - Based on comments from a focus group, can we predict the future rating
of a restaurant before opening ?
