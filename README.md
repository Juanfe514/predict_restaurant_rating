What makes a restaurant successful? For restaurateurs, it is crucial to understand their business in order to improve their performance and increment their clientele. However, in the restaurant industry, making data driven decisions can be challenging. 

With this project, we want to explore all the information contained in TripAdvisor and possibly other data bases to answer the following questions:

 - Based on available public data, Can we help restaurant owners to understand their industry?
 - Can we extract insights to improve the rating of a restaurant that already exists?
 - Based on comments from a focus group, can we predict the future rating of a restaurant before opening ?
